    "content": "<p>A message of peace from the QGIS Community: We, the developers, contributors and community members of the QGIS Project view the ongoing world events in Ukraine and other conflict areas around the world with great sadness. Our aim in developing QGIS has always been to provide a powerful tool to support the creation of a just and humane society. We want to enable a world where every person has a voice, the ability to express, and be secure in, their tenure in their homes, villages, towns, cities and countries.&nbsp;We hope tools like QGIS are used to the benefit of all citizens on earth, to support a sustainable environment, an orderly society and, in particular, to establish and preserve sovereign dignity, security and freedom from oppression.</p>\r\n<p>We ask the leaders of the world to resolve their disputes peacefully, through negotiation and compromise, humility and deference to the citizens who are placed in your care. To the members of the QGIS Community that are caught up in this conflict, our thoughts and support are with you, and we hope that you and your families are safe and that this conflict comes to a speedy end.</p>",
